# Enslaved-People-of-Charlestown-1775
In this project, I helped create detailed and communicative visualizations to illustrate information on the enslaved people of 1775 Charlestown.  Our stakeholders were the archeologists in the City Archeology Program, founded in 1983, which aims to protect Bostonâ€™s irreplaceable archeological resources.
